Onco-Vision: Deep Learning for Tumor Cell Detection in Breast Cancer
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for classifying breast cancer histopathological images as benign or malignant using DenseNet-201, ResNet-101, and InceptionV3 architectures. Our approach leverages transfer learning and image augmentation techniques to improve classification accuracy, with DenseNet-201 achieving up to 93% accuracy on the BreakHis 400x dataset.

📖 Overview
Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent life-threatening diseases. Histopathological analysis is a gold standard for diagnosis but is time-consuming and subjective. Our project, Onco-Vision, addresses this gap using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)—particularly DenseNet-201—to automate and enhance accuracy in tumor cell classification.

🎯 Objectives
Classify histopathological images into benign or malignant.

Leverage transfer learning with pre-trained CNN architectures.

Compare DenseNet-201 performance with ResNet-101 and InceptionV3.

Implement robust preprocessing and augmentation techniques.

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

📊 Results
Model	Accuracy	AUC Score
DenseNet-201	93%	0.88
InceptionV3	87%	0.75
ResNet-101	70%	0.56

DenseNet201 achieved the highest accuracy and stability.

ROC curves and confusion matrices showed strong separability between classes.

⚖️ Comparison
DenseNet201: Efficient and high accuracy; best generalization.

InceptionV3: Lightweight and fast but slightly less accurate.

ResNet-101: Prone to overfitting and less stable.

✅ Conclusion
DenseNet201 proved to be the most suitable model for classifying histopathology images, outperforming others in both accuracy and generalizability. This model can assist pathologists by providing a second opinion and speeding up diagnosis.

🚀 Future Work
Incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM).

Expand to multi-modal datasets (e.g., clinical + imaging).

Deploy to edge/mobile devices for real-time diagnostics.

Use larger, more diverse datasets for better generalization.
