Onco-Vision: Deep Learning for Tumor Cell Detection in Breast Cancer
This project presents a deep learning-based solution for classifying breast cancer histopathological images as benign or malignant using DenseNet-201, ResNet-101, and InceptionV3 architectures. Our approach leverages transfer learning and image augmentation techniques to improve classification accuracy, with DenseNet-201 achieving up to 93% accuracy on the BreakHis 400x dataset.

üìñ Overview
Breast cancer remains one of the most prevalent life-threatening diseases. Histopathological analysis is a gold standard for diagnosis but is time-consuming and subjective. Our project, Onco-Vision, addresses this gap using deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs)‚Äîparticularly DenseNet-201‚Äîto automate and enhance accuracy in tumor cell classification.

üéØ Objectives
Classify histopathological images into benign or malignant.

Leverage transfer learning with pre-trained CNN architectures.

Compare DenseNet-201 performance with ResNet-101 and InceptionV3.

Implement robust preprocessing and augmentation techniques.

Evaluate performance using metrics like accuracy, ROC-AUC, and confusion matrix.

üìä Results
Model	Accuracy	AUC Score
DenseNet-201	93%	0.88
InceptionV3	87%	0.75
ResNet-101	70%	0.56

DenseNet201 achieved the highest accuracy and stability.

ROC curves and confusion matrices showed strong separability between classes.

‚öñÔ∏è Comparison
DenseNet201: Efficient and high accuracy; best generalization.

InceptionV3: Lightweight and fast but slightly less accurate.

ResNet-101: Prone to overfitting and less stable.

‚úÖ Conclusion
DenseNet201 proved to be the most suitable model for classifying histopathology images, outperforming others in both accuracy and generalizability. This model can assist pathologists by providing a second opinion and speeding up diagnosis.

üöÄ Future Work
Incorporate Explainable AI (XAI) techniques (e.g., Grad-CAM).

Expand to multi-modal datasets (e.g., clinical + imaging).

Deploy to edge/mobile devices for real-time diagnostics.

Use larger, more diverse datasets for better generalization.
